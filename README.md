# 🍏 Food Expiry Tracker

### 📌 Problem Statement

Food waste is a significant global issue, with a large portion of it occurring at the consumer level due to expired and forgotten food items. Rising food wastage in urban areas, especially from hotels, canteens, and events, where large quantities of edible food are thrown away daily while many people still go hungry, is a major concern.

This project addresses the challenge of keeping track of food inventory in a simple and efficient way to **minimize waste** and **encourage responsible consumption or donation**.
